        Steps:
    </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Start heating up your pan on medium to medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Start boiling water by filling a pot up with water and putting it on high heat.</li>
        <li>As your water begins boiling, salt it to taste.</li>
        <li>After letting it boil for a couple minutes, add your fettuccine, making sure that everything is covered.</li>
        <li>Set a timer for 9-12 minutes - That's when your noodles will be done.</li>
        <li>In the pan, put one cup (one stick) of butter.</li>
        <li>As your butter melts, add equal amounts of heavy whipping cream (about 1 cup).</li>
        <li>Continue to stir on medium to medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>As the liquids start to evaporate and thicken, optionally add garlic/garlic powder, black pepper, and any other spices you might want.</li>
        <li>About 2-4 minutes before you want to mix everyting together, add equal parts of parmesan cheese (about a cup) and continue to mix continuously.</li>
        <li>As it gets close to the 9-12 minutes, start checking your noodles to see if they're cooked enough for your preference.</li>
        <li>When your noodles are at your preferred texture, take them out and place it into your pan of butter, cream, and cheese.</li>
        <li>Continue mixing the noodles and sauce for a minute or two.</li>
        <li>Optionally add extra spices and extra cheese.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and plate as much or as little as you'd like.</li>
    </ol>
